# Javascript-projects
Minor Javascript projects from the courses DAT101 and DAT200.


# Excavator
A project in DAT200 where an excavator was created in 3Ds Max, and configured using javascript. 

Because of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies enforced by modern browsers, the easiest way to get the project to run is to start a localhost server for example through *python -m http.server 8000* and just navigate to the folder.
